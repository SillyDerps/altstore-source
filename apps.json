You might encounter stuttering, heat, battery drain..., especially when playing at 2160p (4K) quality. However, this should not happen if you use TrollStore.\n- Unless you're using TrollStore, deep-link (aka Open in the YouTube App) simply will not work.\n\nKnown issues:\n- uYou's issues: https://github.com/MiRO92/uYou-for-YouTube/issues\n- uYouPlus's issues: https://github.com/qnblackcat/uYouPlus",
